# marching_cubes
My implementation of marching cubes, based on the implementation at http://paulbourke.net/geometry/polygonise/.

### Usage:
* By default, a sphere will be displayed. Press 2 to display a cube. Press 3 to display a torus. Press 1 to display the sphere again. Press 'esc' to display your desktop.

### Tips:
* You'll need to make sure the GLEW static library is placed in a folder named 'extern' inside the project's root directory. I'm working on getting it to build with the project automatically.
* Make sure to run the app in the same directory as the shaders!
